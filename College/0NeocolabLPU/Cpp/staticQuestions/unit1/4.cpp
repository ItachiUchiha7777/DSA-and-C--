// Single File Programming Question
// Problem Statement



// Shabu works at a library and needs to analyze the frequency of digits in identification numbers. Help Shabu by writing a program that counts how many times each digit (0-9) appears in a given number. The output should use the setw manipulator function for formatting.



// Note: Make the width length as 2.

// Input format :
// The input consists of an integer N, representing the identification number.

// Output format :
// For each digit (0-9) that appears in the number, output the digit and the number of times it appears, formatted with a width of 2 for the count.



// The output should be in the format: "Digit X: Y times", where X is the digit and Y is its count.
